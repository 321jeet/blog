                <p>
                    A waterfall is an area where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops in the
                    course of a stream or river.
                    Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf

                <p>
                    A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town
                    (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns), with a population
                    typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
                    Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain
                    urban neighborhoods.
