                Pyra Labs launched <strong>on August 23, 1999</strong> . It is credited with popularizing the format as
                one of the
                first dedicated blog-publishing tools.
                Pyra Labs was purchased by Google in February 2003 for an undisclosed amount. Premium features, which
                Pyra
                had actually offered for, were made free as a result of the takeover. Evan Williams, a co-founder of
                Pyra
                Labs, leaves Google in October 2004.
                Picasa was acquired by Google in 2004, and Picasa and its photo-sharing service Hello were incorporated
                into
                Blogger, enabling users to upload images to their blogs.

                [8]Blogger underwent a major redesign on May 9, 2004, which included web standards-compliant templates,
                individual archive pages for posts, comments, and email posting.
                Blogger's new version, codenamed "Invader," was released in beta alongside the gold update on August 14,
                2006. Users were moved to Google servers, and new features such as interface language in French,
                Italian,
                German, and Spanish were added.
                <br>

                [9] In December 2006, this new version of Blogger was taken out of beta. By May 2007, Blogger had
                completely
                moved over to Google-operated servers. Blogger was ranked 16 on the list of top 50 domains in terms of
                number of unique visitors in 2007.
                <br>
                [10]On February 24, 2015, Blogger announced that as of late March it will no longer allow its users to
                post
                sexually explicit content, unless the nudity offers "substantial public benefit," for example in
                "artistic,
                educational, documentary, or scientific contexts."
                <br>
                [11] On February 28, 2015, accounting for severe backlash from long-term bloggers, Blogger reversed its
                decision on banning sexual content, going back to the previous policy that allowed explicit images and
                videos if the blog was marked as "adult".
