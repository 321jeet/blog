            <h3>WATERFALL</h3>
            <p>
                A waterfall is a river or other body of water's steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool below.
                Waterfalls are also called cascades.

                The process of erosion, the wearing away of earth, plays an important part in the formation of
                waterfalls. Waterfalls themselves also contribute to erosion.

                Often, waterfalls form as streams flow from soft rock to hard rock. This happens both laterally (as a
                stream flows across the earth) and vertically (as the stream drops in a waterfall). In both cases, the
                soft rock erodes, leaving a hard ledge over which the stream falls.

                A fall line is the imaginary line along which parallel rivers plunge as they flow from uplands to
                lowlands. Many waterfalls in an area help geologists and hydrologists determine a region's fall line and
                underlying rock structure.

                As a stream flows, it carries sediment. The sediment can be microscopic silt, pebbles, or even boulders.
                Sediment can erode stream beds made of soft rock, such as sandstone or limestone. Eventually, the
                stream's channel cuts so deep into the stream bed that only a harder rock, such as granite, remains.
                Waterfalls develop as these granite formations form cliffs and ledges.

                A stream's velocity increases as it nears a waterfall, increasing the amount of erosion taking place.
                The movement of water at the top of a waterfall can erode rocks to be very flat and smooth. Rushing
                water and sediment topple over the waterfall, eroding the plunge pool at the base. The crashing flow of
                the water may also create powerful whirlpools that erode the rock of the plunge pool beneath them.

                The resulting erosion at the base of a waterfall can be very dramatic, and cause the waterfall to
                "recede." The area behind the waterfall is worn away, creating a hollow, cave-like structure called a
                "rock shelter." Eventually, the rocky ledge (called the outcropping) may tumble down, sending boulders
                into the stream bed and plunge pool below. This causes the waterfall to "recede" many meters upstream.
                The waterfall erosion process starts again, breaking down the boulders of the former outcropping.

                Erosion is just one process that can form waterfalls. A waterfall may form across a fault, or crack in
                the Earth’s surface. An earthquake, landslide, glacier, or volcano may also disrupt stream beds and help
                create waterfalls. </p>
            <h3>Classifying Waterfalls:</h3>
            <p>

                There is not a standard way to classify waterfalls. Some scientists classify waterfalls based on the
                average volume of water in the waterfall. A Class 10 waterfall using this scale is Inga Falls,
                Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River twists in a series of rapids. The estimated volume
                of water discharged from Inga Falls is 25,768 cubic meters per second (910,000 cubic feet per second).

                Another popular way of classifying waterfalls is by width. One of the widest waterfalls is Khone
                Phapheng Falls, Laos. At the Khone Phapheng Falls, the Mekong River flows through a succession of
                relatively shallow rapids. The width of the Khone Phapheng Falls is about 10,783 meters (35,376 feet).

                Waterfalls are also classified by height. Angel Falls, the world’s tallest waterfall, plummets 979
                meters (3,212 feet) into a remote canyon in a rain forest in Venezuela. The water, from the Gauja River,
                often does not reach the bottom. The fall is so long, and so steep, that air pressure is stronger often
                than the water pressure of the falls. The water is turned to mist before it reaches the small tributary
                below.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Waterfalls:</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most popular, if least scientific, ways to classify waterfalls is by type. A waterfall's type
                is simply the way the descends. Most waterfalls fit more than one category.

                A block waterfall descends from a wide stream. Niagara Falls, in the U.S. and Canada, is a block
                waterfall on the Niagara River.

                A cascade is a waterfall that descends over a series of rock steps. Monkey Falls, in the Indira Gandhi
                Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park in Tamil Nadu, India, is a gently sloping cascade. The waterfall is
                safe enough for children to play in the water.

                A cataract is a powerful, even dangerous, waterfall. Among the widest and wildest of cataracts are the
                thundering waters of the Iguazu River on the border between Brazil and Argentina.

                A chute is a waterfall in which the stream passage is very narrow, forcing water through at unusually
                high pressure. Three Chute Falls is named for the three "chutes" through which the Tenaya Creek falls in
                Yosemite National Park, California.

                Fan waterfalls are named for their shape. Water spreads out horizontally as it descends. Virgin Falls is
                a striking fan waterfall on Tofino Creek, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

                Frozen waterfalls are just what they sound like. For at least part of the year, the waterfall freezes.
                Mountaineers often climb frozen waterfalls as a challenging test of their skill. The Fang is a single
                pillar of ice in Vail, Colorado that vertically plunges more than 30 meters (100 feet).

                Horsetail waterfalls maintain contact with the hard rock that underlies them. Reichenbach Falls, a fall
                on the Reichenbach Stream in Switzerland, is a horsetail waterfall where legendary detective Sherlock
                Holmes allegedly fell to his doom.

                Multi-step waterfalls are a series of connected waterfalls, each with their own plunge pool. The
                breathtaking "falling lakes" of Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia, are a series of multi-step
                waterfalls.

                Plunge waterfalls, unlike horsetail falls, lose contact with the hard rock. The tallest waterfall in
                Japan, Hannoki Falls, is a plunge waterfall that stands 497 meters (1,640 feet). Hannoki Falls is
                seasonally fed by snowmelt from the Tateyama Mountains.

                Punchbowl waterfalls are characterized by wide pools at their base. Wailua Falls is a punchbowl
                waterfall on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. Although the plunge pool is tranquil and popular for swimming,
                the area around Wailua Falls itself is dangerous.

                The water flowing over segmented waterfalls separate as distinct streams. Huge outcroppings of hard rock
                separate the streams of Nigretta Falls, a segmented waterfall in Victoria, Australia, before they meet
                in a large plunge pool.

                Case Study: Niagara Falls

                The Niagara River has two falls, one in the U.S. state of New York and one in the province of Ontario,
                Canada. Each waterfall is less than 60 meters (200 feet) tall, but together they are more than a
                kilometer (.62 miles) wide.

                Niagara and many other falls with large volumes of water are used to generate hydroelectric power. A
                tremendous volume of water flows over Niagara Falls, as much as 5,525 cubic meters (195,000 cubic feet)
                per second. Power stations upstream from the falls convert hydroelectric energy into electricity for
                residential and commercial use.

                The U.S. and Canadian governments manage the Niagara River so carefully that it is possible for either
                country to "turn off" the falls. This is done at night, so as not to disturb the tourism industry, and
                the falls are never actually turned off, just slowed down. Water is diverted to canals and reservoirs,
                and the decreased flow allows engineers to check for erosion and other damage on the falls. U.S. and
                Canadian authorities also work together to ensure Niagara Falls doesn’t freeze in the winter, which
                would threaten power production.

                Because waterfalls are barriers to navigation, canals are sometimes built to get around them. Niagara
                Falls prevents passage between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on the Niagara River. In the 19th century, the
                Welland Canal was built to make passage between the two Great Lakes possible.

                <h3>VILLAGE</h3>
            </a>



            <p> A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town
                (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns), with a population
                typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
                Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain
                urban
                Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur.
                Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the
                landscape, as a dispersed settlement.


                The old village of Indian
                In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence
                agriculture, and also for some non-agricultural societies. In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the
                right to be called a village when it built a church.
                [1] In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population
                living in them. The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and
                factories;
                the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. This also enabled
                specialization of labor and crafts, and development of many trades. The trend of urbanization
                continues, though not always in connection with industrialization. Historically homes were situated
                together for sociability and defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed.
                Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.
            </p>

            <h3>India</h3>
            <br>

            <p> A typical rural peasant Indian village in Rajasthan, India
                "The soul of India lives in its villages," declared Mahatma Gandhi[6] at the beginning of 20th
                century. According to the 2011 census of India, 68.84% of Indians (around 833.1 million people) live
                in 640,867 different villages.[7] The size of these villages varies considerably. 236,004 Indian
                villages have a population of fewer than 500, while 3,976 villages have a population of 10,000+.
                Most of the villages have their own temple, mosque, or church, depending on the local religious
                following.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Culture and Tradition in Indian villages</h3>



            <p>
                Habitually the Indian villagers manifest a deep loyalty to their villages. The uniqueness of the
                village life in India lies in this deep loyalty which is again marked with a rich culture. The
                mystic charm and the cultural diversities of the village life in India make Indian villages the land
                where beauty never fades away.

                The village life in India is idyllic, unchanging with its immense beauty. The villagers of India are
                normally habituated in sharing and using the common facilities of the village including the village
                shrines and temples, the village pond, schools, grazing grounds, sitting places, etc. This
                interdependence of the village life in India perhaps provides a matchless unity amongst the
                villagers which supports them in surviving amidst thousands of odds. Village unity is therefore the
                primary concern of the village life in India.

            <h3>Rituals in Indian Villages</h3>
            <p>Characteristically, each of the Indian villages recognizes a particular deity as the protector of the
                concerned village and the people of that village get together to worship the deity. The
                uninterrupted village life in India entertain themselves amidst the colour of the festivals like
                Diwali, Holi, Muharram, Dussehra, etc, in the captivating pulse of dance and songs and of course in
                the emotion of rural theatres.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Development of Indian Villages</h3>
            <p>
                Continuous reforms are made by the government in order to fashion the country a ‘motor’ for the
                economy of the world. Developments in the agrarian infrastructure, public sector reforms, rural
                development, righted labour norms, etc have changed the Indian village life. The Government of India
                helped the villages with advanced technology for farming implements and presently most of the
                villages in India have access to modern farming equipments. Now-a-days, the Indian village outskirts
                boast up with food packaging plants, textile industries, sugar industries and steel plants. These
                have created for the village youth suitable employment opportunities.

            <h3> LADDAKH HILL</h3>
            <p>
                is a region administered by India as a union territory, and constitutes a part of the larger Kashmir
                region, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[9][10]
                Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to
                the south, both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the
                Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the
                Karakoram Pass in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north
                to the main Great Himalayas to the south.[11][12] The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai
                Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control
                since 1962.[13][14]

                In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade
                routes,[15] but as the Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh
                in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully
                encouraged tourism in Ladakh. As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military maintains a
                strong presence in the region.

                The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.[16] The
                Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the Suru,
                Dras and Zanskar river valleys. The main populated regions are the river valleys, but the mountain
                slopes also support the pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups in the region are Muslims
                (mainly Shia) (46%), Tibetan Buddhists (40%), Hindus (12%) and others (2%).[17][18] Ladakh is one of the
                most sparsely populated regions in India. Its culture and history are closely related to that of
                Tibet.[19]

                Ladakh was established as a union territory of India on 31 October 2019, following the passage of the
                Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. Prior to that, it was part of the Jammu and Kashmir state. Ladakh
                is the largest and the second least populous union territory of India
            </p><br>
            <h3>Ancient History</h3>
            <p>
                Rock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from Neolithic
                times.[25] Ladakh's earliest inhabitants consisted of a mixed Indo-Aryan population of Mons and
                Dards,[26] who find mention in the works of Herodotus,[c] and classical writers as well as the Indian
                Puranas.[27] Around the 1st century, Ladakh was a part of the Kushan Empire. Buddhism spread into
                western Ladakh from Kashmir in the 2nd century. The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes
                the region in his accounts.[28] Xuanzang's term of Ladakh is Mo-lo-so, which has been reconstructed by
                academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa, which is believed to have been the original name of the region
            </p><br>

                Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
                Main article:</h3>
            <p> Jammu and Kashmir (state)
                At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument
                of Accession to India. Pakistani raiders from Gilgit had reached Ladakh and military operations were
                initiated to evict them. The wartime conversion of the pony trail from Sonamarg to Zoji La by army
                engineers permitted tanks to move up and successfully capture the pass. The advance continued. Dras,
                Kargil and Leh were liberated and Ladakh cleared of the infiltrators.[50]

                In 1949, China closed the border between Nubra and Xinjiang, blocking old trade routes. In 1955 China
                began to build roads connecting Xinjiang and Tibet through the Aksai Chin area. The Indian effort to
                retain control of Aksai Chin led to the Sino-Indian War of 1962, which India lost. China also built the
                Karakoram highway jointly with Pakistan. India built the Srinagar-Leh Highway during this period,
                cutting the journey time between Srinagar and Leh from 16 days to two. The route, however, remains
                closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall. Construction of a 6.5 km (4.0 mi) tunnel across
                Zoji La pass is under consideration to make the route functional throughout the year.

                Ladakh (L) shown in the wider Kashmir region
                The people of Ladakh had been demanding Ladakh to be constituted as a separate territory since 1930s,
                because of perceived unfair treatment by Kashmir and Ladakh's cultural differences with predominantly
                Muslim Kashmir valley, while some people in Kargil opposed union territory status for Ladakh.[25][58]
                The first organized agitation was launched against Kashmir's "dominance" in the year 1964. In late
                1980s, a much larger mass agitation was launched to press their demand for union territory status.[59]

                In August 2019, a reorganisation act was passed by the Parliament of India which contained provisions to
                reconstitute Ladakh as a union territory, separate from the rest of Jammu and Kashmir on 31 October
                2019.[1][60][61][62] Under the terms of the act, the union territory is administered by a Lieutenant
                Governor acting on behalf of the Central Government of India and does not have an elected legislative
                assembly or chief minister. Each district within the union territory continues to elect an autonomous
                district council as done previously.[63]

                The demand for Ladakh as separate union territory was first raised by the parliamentarian Kushok Bakula
                Rinpoche around 1955, which was later carried forward by another parliamentarian Thupstan Chhewang.[64]
                The former Jammu and Kashmir state use to obtain large allocation of annual funds from the union
                government based on the fact that the large geographical area of the Ladakh (comprising 65% of total
                area), but Ladakh was allocated only 2% of the state budget based on its relative population.[64] Within
                the first year of the formation of Ladakh as separate union territory, its annual budget allocation has
                increased 4 times from ₹57 crore to ₹232 crore.</p>

                Main article: Traditional Tibetan medicine
                Tibetan medicine has been the traditional health system of Ladakh for over a thousand years. This school
                of traditional healing contains elements of Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, combined with the philosophy
                and cosmology of Tibetan Buddhism. For centuries, the only medical system accessible to the people have
                been the amchi, traditional doctors following the Tibetan medical tradition. Amchi medicine remains a
                component of public health, especially in remote areas.[126]

                Programmes by the government, local and international organisations are working to develop and
                rejuvenate this traditional system of healing.[126][127] Efforts are underway to preserve the
                intellectual property rights of amchi medicine for the people of Ladakh. The government has also been
                trying to promote the sea buckthorn in the form of juice and jam, as some claim it possess medicinal
                properties.

                The National Research Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh is an institute for research into traditional
                medicine and a hospital providing traditional treatments

                <h3>FOREST</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Although the word forest is commonly used, there is no universally recognised precise definition,
                with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world.
                [4] Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees, under many definitions an
                area
                completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past, will
                grow
                trees in the future,
                [13] or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type.
                [15]

                There are three broad categories of forest definitions in use: administrative, land use, and
                land
                cover.
                [14] Administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land, and
                commonly bear little relationship to the vegetation growing on the land: land that is legally
                designated as a forest is defined as a forest even if no trees are growing on it.
                [14] Land use definitions are based upon the primary purpose that the land serves. For example,
                a
                forest may be defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a
                land
                use definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry, or areas
                within
                the region that have been cleared by harvesting,
                disease or fire are still considered forests even if they contain no trees. Land cover
                definitions
                define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such
                definitions
                typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are
                typically the number of trees per area (density), the area of ground under the tree canopy
                (canopy
                cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area).
                [14] Under such land cover definitions, an area of land can only be known as forest if it is
                growing
                trees.
                Areas that fail to meet the land cover definition may be still included under while immature
                trees
                are establishing if they are expected to meet the definition at maturity.[14]

                Under land use definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are
                between a
                forest, woodland, and savanna. Under some definitions, forests require very high levels of tree
                canopy cover, from 60% to 100%,
                [16] excluding savannas and woodlands in which trees have a lower canopy cover. Other
                definitions
                consider savannas to be a type of forest, and include all areas with tree canopies over 10%.[13]

                Some areas covered with trees are legally defined as agricultural areas, e.g. Norway spruce
                plantations in Austrian forest law when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and below a
                certain height.</p> <br>
            <h3> Layers</h3>
            <p>

                Biogradska forest in Montenegro

                Spiny forest at Ifaty, Madagascar, featuring various Adansonia (baobab) species, Alluaudia
                procera
                (Madagascar ocotillo) and other vegetation
                A forest is made up of many layers. The main layers of all forest types are the forest floor,
                the
                understory and the canopy. The emergent layer exists in tropical rainforests. Each layer has a
                different set of plants and animals depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture and
                food.

                Forest floor contains decomposing leaves, animal droppings, and dead trees. Decay on the forest
                floor forms new soil and provides nutrients to the plants. The forest floor supports ferns,
                grasses,
                mushroom and tree seedlings.
                Understory is made up of bushes, shrubs, and young trees that are adapted to living in the
                shades of
                the canopy.
                Canopy is formed by the mass of intertwined branches, twigs and leaves of the mature trees. The
                crowns of the dominant trees receive most of the sunlight. This is the most productive part of
                the
                trees where maximum food is produced. The canopy forms a shady, protective "umbrella" over the
                rest
                of the forest.
                Emergent layer exists in the tropical rain forest and is composed of a few scattered trees that
                tower over the canopy.[27]
                However, in botany and many countries (Germany, Poland, etc.), a different classification of
                forest
                vegetation structure is often used: tree, shrub, herb and moss layers, see stratification
                (vegetation).</p>

            <h3>Forests and Wildlife:</h3>

            <p> A forest is a large area of land that is dominated by trees, aquatic biomes, animals belonging to
                several species, and a million varieties of microorganisms.
                We can find many wild animals present in the forests. Forests and wildlife are interdependent in the
                environment. There are various uses of forests like wood, timber, medicinal plants used for the extract
                of medicinal content from the various leaves, etc. We should ban people from hunting wild animals for
                their skin, bones, etc., which results in the decline of the respective species. What would happen if
                forests disappear? Does deforestation kill animals?
                Let’s explore more about forests and wildlife and how to conserve forests and wildlife in detail in the
                given below article.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Flora and Fauna In India:</h3>
            <p>

                If we look around us, we will be able to find a variety of plants and animals. Flora refers to the plant
                population, whereas fauna refers to the animal population. India is one of the world’s richest and
                diversified countries in terms of its vast arrangement of biological diversity.

                1. This is possibly twice or thrice the number yet to be discovered.
                2. These diverse flora and fauna are so well integrated into daily life that we take these for granted.
                3. But, lately, they are under great stress. About 10% of India’s recorded wild flora and 20% of its
                mammals are on the threatened list.
                4. Many flora and fauna would now be categorized as ‘critical,’ that is on the verge of extinction, such
                as forest spotted owlet, cheetah, pink-headed duck, mountain quail, madhuca insignis (Mahua), etc.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Significance of Forests:</h3>
            <p>
                1. Forests prevent soil erosion and help in maintaining the soil fertile.
                2. Forests control natural calamities such as drought and floods in an area.
                3. Forests provide raw materials for humans with various products used in regular life.
                4. They help in regulating the climatic conditions of a particular area and help in inducing rainfall.
                5. Forests help in maintaining the balance in the ecosystem.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Stakeholders:</h3>
            <p>
                Stakeholders are the different groups of people who are interested in the conservation of forests and
                wildlife.

                1. Local People: The people who are living in forests depend on many resources like wood, timber, etc.
                Wood for cooking of food and to make themselves warm during winter seasons. They collect the dried wood,
                or they only cut the branches of trees to make their huts. These people do not harm the forests, and
                they know how to take care of forests since it’s their homes.
                2. Industrialists: Industrialists depend on various forest products such as raw materials like wood,
                leaves, jutting branches, etc. They supply to various industries like lac industry, paper industry,
                timber industry, etc., which is leading to deforestation. The industrialists do not depend on only one
                area for the extraction of raw materials.
                3. Forest Department of Government: The forest department owns the lands of the forest and controls the
                forest resources in a systematic manner.
                4. Wildlife and Nature Enthusiasts: The people are not dependent on the forest for any sort of
                resources, but they conserve the forest resources in their original condition without any spoilage.

            </p><br>
            <h3>Factors Responsible for the Depletion of Forest and Wildlife:</h3>
            <p>
                1. Agricultural Expansion: After 1947, agricultural expansion continues to be one of the major causes of
                the depletion of forest resources. Between 1951 and 1980, as per the Forest Survey of India, over 26,200
                sq. km. of forest area was converted into agricultural land all over India.
                2. Colonial Rule: The greatest damage inflicted on Indian forests during this time was due to the
                expansion of the railways, agricultural lands, commercial and scientific forestry, mining activities,
                etc.
                3. Development Projects: Since 1951, over 5,000 sq km of forest was cleared for river valley projects.
                Clearing forests is still continuing with projects like the Narmada Sagar Project in Madhya Pradesh,
                which would inundate 40,000 hectares of forest.
                4. Shifting Agriculture: Substantial parts of the tribal belts, especially in northeastern and central
                India, have been deforested or degraded by shifting cultivation (jhum), a type of slash and burn
                agriculture.
                5. Mining: It is another essential factor behind deforestation. The Buxa Tiger Reserve in West Bengal is
                seriously endangered by the ongoing dolomite mining. It has disturbed the natural habitat of various
                species and blocked the migration route of several others, including the great Indian elephant.
                6. Grazing and Fuel-wood Collection: Overgrazing leads to the destruction of forests and soil erosion.
                But a substantial part of the fuel-fodder demand is met by lopping rather than by entire felling trees.
