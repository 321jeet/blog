            <p> Blogger is an American online content management system (CMS) which enables multi-user blogs with
                time-stamped entries.
                Pyra Labs developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003.
                Google hosts the blogs, which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Blogs can also be
                accessed from a user-owned custom domain (such as www.example.com)
                by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google's servers. A user can have up to 100 blogs or
                websites per account.

                <p>
                    A waterfall is an area where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops in the
                    course of a stream or river.
                    Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf

                <p>
                    A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town
                    (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns), with a population
                    typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
                    Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain
                    urban neighborhoods.
